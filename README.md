## Overview

In this study, we investigated the relationship between routine behaviors andfeelings of regret, focusing on two thought experiments: a hitchhiking scenarioand a car accident scenario. We replicated and expanded upon previous researchfindings. Our results indicate that individuals tend to experience higher levelsof regret in situations that deviate from their routine or normal behavior

-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean data, and generate graphs.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, Codriver. The abstract and introduction were written with the help of Chatgpt-4 and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
